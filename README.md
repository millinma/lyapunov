# lyapunov

This repository is supposed to reproduce some common pictures of the Lyapunov Space (e.g. Zircon Zity, Jellyfish, The Swallow)

The 'colormap.py' is a python program to reproduce pictures in the lyapunov space.

The 'Pr√§sentation.tex' can be built into a presentation for a course of the university of Augsburg.

The 'population_development.py' produces some plots for the chaotic and non-chaotic development of a population according to the logistic equation.

The 'Lyapunov.py' is currently not working, so it has no purpose
